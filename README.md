# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Transformers-Tensorflow-and-BERT-Model

Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a sentiment analysis system using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages the power of Transformers and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, implemented with TensorFlow, to classify text data into different sentiment categories. This repository contains code, data, and instructions to build and train a sentiment analysis model from scratch, as well as to perform inference on new data.

Features

BERT Model: Utilizes the pre-trained BERT model for robust feature extraction and sentiment classification.
Transformers Library: Employs Hugging Face's Transformers library for seamless integration and model management.
TensorFlow Framework: Implements the model using TensorFlow for efficient training and deployment.
Data Preprocessing: Includes scripts for data cleaning, tokenization, and preparation for training.
Model Training: Provides customizable training scripts with options for fine-tuning hyperparameters.
Inference Pipeline: Contains a streamlined pipeline for performing sentiment analysis on new text data.
Evaluation Metrics: Measures performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
